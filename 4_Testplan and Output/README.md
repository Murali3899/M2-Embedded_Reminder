So here i have created a circuit using atmega328 microcontroller 

I have connected eight LEDS on the port B

From each port there is one LED from Zero to Seven and 

On the port D, I have connected a Relay and this relay will switch ON the buzzer



#  Procedure :

 Burn the hex file to the controller
 
 program will send the values from 0 to 255 on port D
 
 Make the port D High to turn on Relay
 
 And the buzzer will make a sound
 
 
 # Output :
 
  Click on load firmware
  
  locate my Hex file
  
  Burn hex file on controller
  
  Then just run the simulation
  
  LEDs are getting blinking according to send the values to port B from 0-255 and also see the relay gets triggered and buzzer sound also we can heard.
